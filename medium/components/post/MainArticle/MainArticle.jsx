          The human body is subject to innumerable metaphors: Our brains are
          computers with immense processing power; our bodies are machines that
          need to be tuned and honed and oiled and optimized.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 mt-10">
          But metaphors are just that — metaphors. While they’re useful for
          interpreting and explaining the world to ourselves, they aren’t always
          reflective of reality. They’re not always real. The effects of
          believing in them, though, can have very real-world effects.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 mt-10">
          The body as a machine, as mechanics, is a perfect example of this.
          What’s known as “locomotion studies” or biophysical mechanics, is
          hundreds of years old. Its most established foundations were built by
          looking at the human body as so much discrete, barely connected parts,
          and in many ways we’re still left with the legacy of that
          understanding.f
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 mt-10">
          Some of the most in-depth studies on locomotion were done by the Weber
          brothers — Ernst, Wilhelm, and Eduard Weber, born into an academic
          family in Saxony (what is now Germany) in the early 1800s. All three
          of them were fascinated with human locomotion, as I wrote about in A
          Walking Life:

        <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 mt-10">
          The subsequent two centuries built on the Webers’ work, with all
          varieties of scientific fields leading to our understanding of human
          locomotion.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 mt-10">
          This research has led to big strides in research on human physiology.
          In the mid-1800s, German physicist and physician Hermann von
          Helmholtz’s research on the eye showed that how we perceive the world
          depends not just on passive reception of sensory signals, but on
          motion.s

          How we interact with that world also has an effect on our locomotion,
          on our physical being overall. Embodiment research and incorporating
          ideas like interoception might be the new Weber-ish foundations of
          locomotion studies. How we move through the world is informed very
          much by how the world moves through us, and vice versa. What can
          understanding that tell us about our physical and mental existence
          throughout our lives?
